    [React's Strict Mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html)
    Strict mode canâ€™t automatically detect side effects for you, 
    but it can help you spot them by making them a little more deterministic.
    This is done by intentionally **double-invoking** the following functions:
    
    * Functions passed to `useState`, `useMemo`, or `useReducer`
    * Function component bodies
*/

// const StrictMode = <React.StrictMode>
//     <App />
// </React.StrictMode>

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();
